# Offline Synchronization

This feature is now available in the BaasBox Android SDK.

It allows to develop an Android mobile application with BaasBox that can run in *offline mode*.
This means you can create an app that is able to save data in a *local storage* on the client, perform CRUD offline operations on the data previously saved and **synchronize** the local data with the Server when the connection will be restored.
